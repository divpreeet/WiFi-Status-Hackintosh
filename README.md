## How this works 

this is a simple menubar app made in swift, it shows the current wifi you are on, the current IP, and then the ability to connect and reconect. something that you **CANT** do is connect to different wifi's (yet), this simply runs the helper script on startup and connects to the last wifi!

### Features

- Connect to the last wifi you were connected to.
- Show the current IP address of the wifi you are connected to 
- Refresh wifi status
- Play a ping sound once you connect to the wifi

### Future Plans
- Get wifi connection working
- Disconnect to the wifi
